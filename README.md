# PIGSquad Git Workshop
_June 5th, 2019_

## Hello!

This is the repository I've prepared for the PIGSquad June 2019 workshop on git. My hope is it'll contain everything you need to follow along through the workshop itself, and it can also serve as a reference point to come back to when you get lost or need to look something up.

Learning git can be a little disorienting at first because, in many cases, you're learning how to solve a problem you may not yet have run into. But I promise that if you stick with me for the duration of this workshop, you'll understand:

1. What a version control system (VCS) is and how it works
2. When a VCS, such as git, is useful — or _not_ useful
3. How to use git to manage and track a programming project (such as a website, a video game, or anything else that involves digital files)

## Resources
**This repository**

If you're reading [this][this repo], that's great! You're right where you need to be.

Don't forget that you can view the entire history of this repo by viewing all the [commits][this repo - commits] on the `master` branch.

**_[Pro Git]_, by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub**

This is the git bible, and it's available for free. It's shockingly readable, accessible, and human, and if you really want to go deep into how git works, it'll take you there. Absolutely essential as a reference. If you take away one resource from this workshop, please make it this one.

**The _[Learn Enough]_ series, by Michael Hartl**

When I was first learning how to program, I was scared of the command line. But this series of books — all free, all online, all about an hour to work through — was the perfect introduction. Those books are:

1. _[Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous][Hartl - command line]_
2. _[Learn Enough Text Editor to Be Dangerous][Hartl - text editor]_
3. _[Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous][Hartl - git]_

While the third book in the trilogy is all about git, and I'd highly recommend it as a way to reinforce and expand upon what we talked about today, I'd really encourage you to start with book 1 and work through all three.

**[GitHub for Unity]**

I just learned this exists, so I have no idea if it's any good, but it sounds handy if you prefer GUIs to the command line. Might be useful if you're primarily familiar with Unity, especially if you expect to work with large files — it says it has LFS baked in.
